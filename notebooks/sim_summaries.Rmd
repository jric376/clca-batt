```{r}
# having errors with sourcing R files
# test <- get_run_results("vrf_02")
test_df <- test$df
test_summ <- test$summ
ggplot(data = test_df) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = pv_levcost_lo), fill = "red",  binwidth = 500) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = pv_levcost_hi), fill = "red",  binwidth = 500) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = lsc_lo), fill = "blue",  binwidth = 500) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = lsc_hi), fill = "blue", binwidth = 500) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = control_cost), fill = "black", binwidth = 500) +
    geom_histogram(aes(x = dr_cost), fill = "grey65", binwidth = 500) +
    scale_fill_discrete()
  
```
